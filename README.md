**gmaps2osm** is a lightweight web tool that converts Google Maps URLs into OpenStreetMap (OsmAnd) links. It's useful if you use a degoogled OS without Google Maps, and need to be able to open location links that friends might send you.

## Features

- Paste a Google Maps URL and get an equivalent OpenStreetMap link
- Supports various Google Maps link formats (including redirects). (Links that end with **.preview.copy** are not yet supported, but it is planned)
- Copy the OSM link with a single click
- Can be used as a regular web page on both destop or mobile, or added to your mobile device's home screen as a PWA
- No API keys required
